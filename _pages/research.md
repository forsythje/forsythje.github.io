My research seeks to advance global environmental health by reducing exposure to environmental hazards among the globe's most vulnerable individuals. Environmental hazards disproportionately affect low-income and marginalized populations. They also present a critical sustainability issue: reliance on the overuse of toxic substances to derive economic profits, despite a perpetual cycle of devastation for all living organisms. Environmental health and justice are at the core of what I do and guide not only what I choose to focus on in my research, but also where and how I conduct research. 
 
I integrate tools from the natural and social sciences to: 1) characterize environmental hazards; and 2) develop and evaluate strategies to reduce the health and developmental burden from environmental hazards that are aligned with local incentives and policies. 
 
One of my focal research efforts identified lead chromate adulterated turmeric as a source of lead exposure in Bangladesh. After using a combination of field and laboratory methods to identify this source ([Env. Res. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118302196), [ES&T 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7705119/),  [Env. Res. 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/user/identity/landing?code=prmCsgDmR8HPrEypngzDS64wZ2WklmtZIFth9UbB&state=retryCounter%3D0%26csrfToken%3D6c33fb9c-e172-4217-a00d-da12e77c705b%26idpPolicy%3Durn%253Acom%253Aelsevier%253Aidp%253Apolicy%253Aproduct%253Ainst_assoc%26returnUrl%3D%252Fscience%252Farticle%252Fpii%252FS0013935119305195%26prompt%3Dnone%26cid%3Darp-340f9a43-6162-4b9d-8aa9-051ad522dedb)) I used a participatory action research approach to develop and implement a multifaceted intervention (Env. Res. In Review). Specifically, I engaged with and involved turmeric businesspeople, the public and government food safety officers. Collaboratively, we raised awareness and influenced policy. Within months, the prevalence of lead-tainted turmeric in marketplaces dropped by more than 95%, and no lead has been detected for the past two years. I am now leading a study to compare present-day and historic blood lead levels among 1,400 pregnant women and children across Bangladesh to assess changes in lead poisoning over the past decade. I have also expanded the spice lead research to other countries in South and Central Asia with many international collaborators. Information about aspects of our collaborative initiative can be found here.
 
My research has been featured in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/28/turmeric-wellness-potion-moment-may-owe-its-yellow-color-lead-contamination-study-says/), [The Scientist](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/yellow-dye-in-turmeric-linked-with-lead-poisoning-in-bangladesh-66854), [Stanford News](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/09/24/lead-found-turmeric/) (top 10 story of the year), among other outlets.
