Welcome! I am an applied interdisciplinary environmental health researcher with training and experience in quantitative and qualitative methods. I am currently a research scientist affiliated with the School of Medicine, Woods Institute for the Environment and King Center for Global Development and a member of the Maternal and Child Health Research Institute. I received my PhD in Environment and Resources at Stanford in June 2019, with advising from Stanford faculty [Stephen Luby](https://profiles.stanford.edu/stephen-luby), [Scott Fendorf](https://earth.stanford.edu/people/scott-fendorf), [Nicole Ardoin](https://profiles.stanford.edu/nicole-ardoin), and Johns Hopkins faculty [Peter Winch](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/755/peter-john-winch).

I am passionate about making an impact in my research and equally committed to mentoring and training the next generation of environmental problem solvers. I have addressed global environmental health problems, particularly contaminants in air, water, soil, and food, with a recent emphasis on lead exposure. I have conducted research in South Asia, East Africa, Central America and the Pacific. I currently manage a research portfolio of related projects aimed at reducing the human and planetary health burden of lead pollution in South Asia over the period 2018-2026. With in-country partners, my primary achievement over the past 5 years has been to get the lead out of turmeric in Bangladesh.
