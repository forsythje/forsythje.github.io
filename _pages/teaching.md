I am honored to train the next generation of environmental problem solvers. My teaching philosophy emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and feedback for iterative improvement, building inclusive and interactive learning environments that engage and inspire diverse student populations, and coursework that engages students in solving real world problems, via project-based service learning or case studies that encourage critical thinking.
 
One of my most profound teaching experiences has been as a co-instructor for “[Practical Approaches to Global Health Research](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&q=INTLPOL+290%3A+Practical+Approaches+to+Global+Health+Research&collapse=)” with faculty Steve Luby. This unique course focuses on process not product, iteratively developing a single research proposal. I taught the students one day per week in a lecture- and discussion-based format. I encouraged students to ask meaningful questions, develop approaches to answer these questions, and critically reflect and iterate to improve their process.
 
Alongside faculty Nicole Ardoin I have helped teach “[Research Approaches for Environmental Problem Solving](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=ENVRES+330%3a+Research+Approaches+for+Environmental+Problem+Solving&view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&academicYear=20222023),” as a graduate student. This is a graduate-level research methods course for PhD students in the interdisciplinary environmental science program E-IPER.
 
I have mentored more than 20 undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom were first-generation college students. Additionally, at my field sites in Bangladesh and Kenya, I have mentored more than 10 early career scientists, three of whom I coached to publish their first scientific manuscript.
